This repo contains/will contain an assortment of math projects I am working on. Since this is just for fun, if so desired, feel free to work on any of these or even contact with any insights.

## Sequences of perfect powers with perfect power differences

Shortname: PPwPPD

Area: number theory

Define the function a(k,0) = k and a(k,n+1) as being the lowest perfect power (i.e. n expressible as m^k where m >= 1, k > 1) such that a(k,n+1) - a(k,n) is also a perfect power, or 0 if no such perfect power exists.
This project examines properties of the function a(k,i) for fixed k. More info can be found in the folder itself.
