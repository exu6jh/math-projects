# Math Projects

This repo contains/will contain an assortment of math projects I am working on. Since this is just for fun, if so desired, feel free to work on any of these or even contact with any insights. Also note that, unless otherwise noted, I'm pretty sure none of these have any serious merit. It's really just for fun.

## Sequences of perfect powers with perfect power differences

Shortname: PPwPPD

Area: number theory

Define the function a(k,0) = k and a(k,n+1) as being the lowest perfect power (i.e. n expressible as m^k where m >= 1, k > 1) such that a(k,n+1) - a(k,n) is also a perfect power, or 0 if no such perfect power exists.
This project examines properties of the function a(k,i) for fixed k. More info can be found in the folder itself.

## Covering systems of quadratic residues

Shortname: CSoQR

Area: number theory

Covering systems are finite sets of ordered pairs (a_i, n_i) such that every integer is congruent to some a_i modulo n_i. A number q is a quadratic residue of a modulus n if q is congruent to some perfect square modulo n.
This project examines whether there exists some covering system composed solely of (a_i, n_i) such that a_i is a quadratic residue of n_i. More info can be found in the folder itself.

The core problem of this project has been SOLVED.
