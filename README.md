# Math Projects

This repo contains/will contain an assortment of math projects I am working on. Since this is just for fun, if so desired, feel free to work on any of these or even contact with any insights. Also note that, unless otherwise noted, I'm pretty sure none of these have any serious merit. It's really just for fun.

## Sequences of perfect powers with perfect power differences

Shortname: PPwPPD

Area: number theory

Define the function a(k,0) = k and a(k,n+1) as being the lowest perfect power (i.e. n expressible as m^k where m >= 1, k > 1) such that a(k,n+1) - a(k,n) is also a perfect power, or 0 if no such perfect power exists.
This project examines properties of the function a(k,i) for fixed k. More info can be found in the folder itself.

## Covering systems of quadratic residues

Shortname: CSoQR

Area: number theory

Covering systems are finite sets of ordered pairs (a_i, n_i) such that every integer is congruent to some a_i modulo n_i. A number q is a quadratic residue of a modulus n if q is congruent to some perfect square modulo n.
This project examines whether there exists some covering system composed solely of (a_i, n_i) such that a_i is a quadratic residue of n_i. More info can be found in the folder itself.

The core problem of this project has been SOLVED.

## Projects I would love to add but that I do not know how to turn into coding projects:

1. Dissections into equal parts

It turns out that figuring out whether given shapes can be dissected into some number of equal copies of any smaller subshape (equal under translation and rotation, that is; not scaling) is really difficult. There are numerous results about dissections into some number of equal-area subshapes (e.g. consider Monsky's theorem which holds that it is impossible to divide a square up into an odd number of equal-area subshapes), and naturally impossibility results regarding those preclude certain dissections into equal copies of smaller subshapes (Monsky's theorem immediately shows that you naturally can't divide a square into an odd number of equal copies of triangles.) However, this is generally restricted to very specific cases, which doesn't give us the generality we need.

One particularly devious subset of this problem is the dissection of oddities of n polyominoes into 2n equal copies of smaller subshapes. An oddity is a symmetrical figure made of an odd number of copies of a polyomino. Naturally such figures can be split into n equal copies of smaller connected subshapes, and 2 equal copies of smaller subshapes, most of the time which are connected. But the question of whether this entails that such figures can be split into 2n equal copies of smaller connected subshapes (something I suspect is false) is still open. If I ever figure out how to code something like this up, I will. I'm open to ideas! ;)
